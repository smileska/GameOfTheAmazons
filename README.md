# Game of the Amazons - Artificial Intelligence

## Project Description 
This project implements a **multi-agent environment** in the **Game of the Amazons**, utilizing adversarial search algorithms such as:
- **MiniMax** 
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning** 
- **ExpectiMax** 

The project was developed as part of the **"Artificial Intelligence"** course at **FINKI**, February 2025.

## How Does the Game Work?
Game of the Amazons is an **abstract strategy game** where **two players** compete to block their opponent by **placing arrows** on the board. Players move like a **queen in chess**, and the winner is the one who leaves the opponent without legal moves.

In this modified version:
- Players compete on a **6x6 board** (instead of the standard 10x10).
- Each player has **only one Amazon** (instead of four).
- The **MiniMax, Alpha-Beta, and ExpectiMax** algorithms are used to compute optimal moves.

## Key Features
✅ **AI vs. AI matches**  
✅ **Human vs. AI mode**   
✅ **Graphical visualization of results**   
✅ **Dynamic decision-making with randomization for diverse strategies**   

## How to Run the Game?
1️⃣ **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/angelaangeleska/GameOfTheAmazons.git
cd GameOfTheAmazons
```

2️⃣ **Install dependencies**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3️⃣ **Run the game**  
- **If you already have Jupyter Notebook open:** Simply open the `.ipynb` file and run all the cells.  
- **If Jupyter is not running yet:** Start it by running:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
